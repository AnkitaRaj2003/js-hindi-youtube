Q What is JS?
JavaScript is a programming language used in web pages to add interactivity and dynamic behavior, beyond just structure (HTML) and style (CSS).

- JS is a loosely types language

🔹 Scope of Variables
Q: What is the scope of variables declared with var, let, and const?
var → function-scoped (or globally scoped if declared outside a function).
let & const → block-scoped (accessible only inside { } where declared).
👉 Example:
if (true) {
  var a = 10;
  let b = 20;
}
console.log(a); // 10 ✅
console.log(b); // ReferenceError ❌

🔹 Hoisting
Q: What is hoisting in JavaScript?
Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution.
var → hoisted & initialized as undefined.
let & const → hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone).
👉 Example:
console.log(x); // undefined (var hoisted)
var x = 5;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
let y = 10;

🔹 Difference between var, let, and const
Feature	                    var	                      let	                  const
Scope	                      Function/global	          Block	                Block
Redeclaration              	✅ Allowed	              ❌ Not allowed	      ❌ Not allowed
Reassignment	              ✅ Allowed  	            ✅ Allowed	          ❌ Not allowed
Hoisting	                  Hoisted → undefined	      Hoisted → TDZ	        Hoisted → TDZ
Initialization	            Optional	                Optional	            Mandatory at declaration

=> Datatypes in JS: Number, String, Boolean, NULL, Undefined, Objects

- NULL: null is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It means “nothing” or “empty value”.
- Undefined: undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript that means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value yet. It’s the default value given by JavaScript.
- Objects: An object is a collection of key-value pairs (properties). Keys are strings (or symbols), and values can be any data type, including other objects or functions.
let person = {
  name: "Ankita",
  age: 22,
  greet: function() { console.log("Hello!"); }
};
- NaN: NaN stands for “Not-a-Number”. It is a special numeric value that represents a value that cannot be converted to a valid number.

=> typeof operator - give type of a variable
=> Converting a string to Number: '123'*1
whereas 'a'*1 give NaN bcz it is not a valid operation
