Q What is Node JS?
ðŸ”¹ JavaScript Engines & Runtime
JavaScript itself is just a language. It needs an engine to run.
Every browser has its own engine:
Chrome, Edge â†’ V8
Firefox â†’ SpiderMonkey
Safari â†’ JavaScriptCore (a.k.a. Nitro)
ðŸ”¹ Node.js
Node.js = V8 Engine + C++ APIs
Itâ€™s a javascript runtime environment, meaning it provides everything needed to run JS outside the browser.
Example: File system access, networking, OS operations â€” things browsers donâ€™t allow.
Thatâ€™s why with Node.js, you can build servers, command-line tools, real-time apps etc.
